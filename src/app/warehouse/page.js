I need to see the current file content first to properly add the destructuring assignments at the correct lines. Could you please provide the current content of the src/app/warehouse/page.js file, or at least the sections around lines 197 and 665 where you want to add these destructuring assignments?

Alternatively, if you have the complete file content, please share it so I can make the precise updates you've requested.
